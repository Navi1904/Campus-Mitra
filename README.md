To install Django and set up project:

# Create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv env
```
    
 ```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
    source env/bin/activate
```
    
``` bash
# Install Django
    pip install django
```

``` bash
# Start a new Django project
    django-admin startproject mysite .

After running the last command, open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see your Django app in action.
